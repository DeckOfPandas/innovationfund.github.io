### Frequently Asked Questions

#### What costs can be included - Can you give any examples of the kinds of things you might fund?

Funding can be used to support direct expenditure required to develop the proposed project. Examples may include:

* Paying for a short promotional film or website to explain the problem you’re trying to address or the benefits of your approach
* Paying for software development to help you move forward with for instance creating or improving a prototype
* Funding travel for participants in user testing and research workshops to gain a deeper understanding of your problem space

We won’t fund purchases of hardware, legal fees or general overheads of your organization.

#### How will the application process work?

After the initial application form above, we will shortlist selected projects and conduct phone interviews with the applicants during the 13th - 15th December. At this stage we are likely to request some additional information from applicants, which we will use to make a final decision by the end of Monday 18th December

* Phone screens for shortlist 13th-15th
* Any clarifying details by Mon 18th 09:00
* Funding decisions by Mon 18th Dec 17:00
* Applicants informed Tue 19th Dec 09:30
* Projects start from Jan 2018

#### Who owns IP for materials produced by funding from the Access to Innovation Fund?

The IP remains with you as an applicant, although we expect materials directly funded by this fund to be released under a free software license.

#### What is Boehringer Ingelheim’s involvement in the fund?

The Access to Innovation fund is a sum of money donated by Boehringer Ingelheim Ltd to support clinical innovation that benefits patients and their care. 

The fund will be held and apportioned by the Apperta Foundation, a clinician led not-for-profit community interest company supported by NHS England and NHS Digital.

In order to comply with Boehringer Ingelheim Ltd's governance framework, the following strict rules apply to decisions regarding grantees:

* There should be no link to or mention of Boehringer Ingelheim Ltd products whatsoever
* Projects should have the aim of enhancing patient care and supporting the NHS, preferably regarding the management of long term conditions, but other projects are welcome
* The fund is for social enterprise use only, and cannot be apportioned to any profit-making companies
* An independent panel, over which Boehringer Ingelheim will have no influence, will hold and distribute relevant funds to those who are eligible

#### I don’t have a social enterprise and I’m not sure I want to start a new one for this funding - what should I do?

We understand. Setting up a new social enterprise brings its own administrative and legal obligations, and takes you away from actually developing your ideas and project. If you’re not sure you’re ready yet to have a dedicated social enterprise just for your project, that’s OK.

Although the governance of the fund means we have to award money to social enterprises and we can’t award it to individuals directly, we may be able to help find a social enterprise with appropriate governance willing to hold the cash for your project on your behalf.

If this sounds like you, then do get in touch to discuss further at innovationfund@apperta.org 

#### I don’t have a prototype yet, what should I do?

If you don’t have a prototype yet that’s fine - it just means you have a little further to go along your journey ! This programme is specifically seeking projects that have spent some time exploring their problem domain and validating their ideas. That’s one of the reasons we’re launching this fund to coincide with NHS Ideas Lab. Hackathons are a great way to spend some time working with a small multidisciplinary team and perhaps develop an initial prototype of your idea.

If you’d like to know more about how to get your idea to the point where you have a prototype, as well as other things that you can learn and do related to clinical innovation we’d love to talk to you anyway - part of what we do at Apperta is helping people along that journey. Drop us a line at innovationfund@apperta.org

#### How long is the project expected to take and when is the earliest funds would be made available?

We expect most projects to be completed within six months, although if you have a particular reason to extend this we will consider extending this time frame. We would expect that projects commenced within the first quarter of 2018, and we should be in a position to release funds from January.

#### What do you mean by social enterprise as opposed to profit making company?

The institution applying must be a registered charity, community interest company, or non-dividend paying company limited by guarantee. This is a red-line condition for all applications.

#### Would you be prepared to part-fund a project?

In principle, yes. You should be prepared to provide details of the additional funding and we would be unlikely to fund projects where your additional funding had not yet been secured.

#### Will I be able to get feedback on my application if it has been unsuccessful? 

We will be able to provide feedback on applications to those applicants who make the shortlist, however we are unable to provide feedback to all applications.

#### What expectation do you have of me as an applicant ?

As well as developing your project: 

* We expect that any software produced as part of this funding, and any documents or materials that are produced must be released under a free software or creative commons license.
* We expect you to write two short (500 words or so) public guest posts on our blog about your project - one at the start explaining the problem space you are exploring, and another at the end to share what you’ve learnt and what you did over the course of the project. 

#### Do you pay VAT?

No. Projects will be supported as a charitable grant, and as such awards are not liable for VAT.

#### Can I apply from outside the UK

For this round, applications are limited to organizations based within the UK.

#### Do you have a preferable referencing style? 
No.
