The Access to Innovation Fund is a new grant fund focussed on supporting people with early stage innovative ideas with the aim of **enhancing patient care and supporting the NHS**. Although applications regarding the management of long term conditions are encouraged, other areas will also be considered.

The fund has been donated by **Boehringer Ingelheim Ltd** but will be **independently administered** and distributed by the **Apperta Foundation**. Successful applications must be through **social enterprises** and applications from profit making companies will not be considered.

Apperta are seeking projects which **already have a prototype** of their product, approach or innovation but require a **bridging investment** to develop further prior to a pilot.

In order to maximise the dissemination and benefit to the NHS any software produced as part of this funding, and any documents or other materials that are produced must be released under a **free software or creative commons licence**.

Individual awards are likely to be in the region of **£10,000 to £25,000**. Proposals exceeding this range should make an exceptional case based on value and impact of the proposed project.

The deadline for applications is **Friday 8 December 13:00 GMT**.

Further details and answers to frequently asked questions may be found below, while applicants may contact innovationfund@apperta.org should they have further questions.
